# Angular 6 Material Template
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8. The template has Material 6 installed and shows how custom components containing Material Design can be used. The style files use SCSS, and the template has a placeholder file for routing. Find out more about Material Design Components here https://material.angular.io/components/categories. 

Note that current Angular 6 version does warns about vulnerabilities when generating a new project. These are related to testing tools and therefore will not affect the functionality of the actual application. The issue is under discussion here (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10963).

## Getting started
- `git glone https://github.com/Zuzze/Angular6-Material-Boilerplate.git`
